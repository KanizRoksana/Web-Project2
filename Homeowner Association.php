	<h2>Trash PICKUP</h2>
	<p>We make it easy with mixed recycling which allows you to throw all of your acceptable recyclables into designated bins. <br>Benefits include:</p>
	<ul>
	<li><p><b>Ease:</b> If it’s an acceptable recyclable (acceptable recyclables vary by region),<br> put it in the designated bins. We’ll take care of the rest</p></li>
	<li><p><b>Time Saving:</b> Putting everything into one designated bin saves you valuable time</p></li>
	<li><p><b>Less Waste: </b>We ensure recyclable materials find their next best use</p></li>
	<li><p><b>Less Traffic:</b> Designated bins means simplified pickups and fewer trucks on the road </p></li>
	<li><p><b>Energy Savings:</b> Recycling can deliver tangible energy savings by creating new products out of excess materials</p></li>
	</ul>
