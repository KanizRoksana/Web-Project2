 <h1>PERSONALIZED RECYCLING SOLUTIONS</h1>
 <p>Waste Management has a variety of hassle-free solutions to ensure homes, businesses and industries have

 <h2>Cleaner Recycling for Better Reuse</h2>
 <p>One non-recyclable item in your container may seem like a minor detail, but 
 it can contaminate an entire batch of recyclables and prevent them from find
 ing a second life. Waste Management has made the recycling process simpler 
 with mixed recycling, but knowing what can and can’t be recycled and being 
 vigilant about what goes into your bin can help you recycle right, every time.</p>
 
 <ol>
  <li>Recycle empty bottles, cans, paper and cardboard</li>
  <li>Keep food and liquids out of your recycling receptacle</li>
  <li>Make sure none of the recyclables are bagged, as plastic bags are not recyclable curbside.
  Check with local retailers for plastic bag recycling options.</li>
 </ol>
