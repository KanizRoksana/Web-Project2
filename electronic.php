 <h1>HANDLING BULBS, BATTERIES & ELECTRONICS THE RIGHT WAY</h1>  
 <img src="image/elec1.jpg" align="right">
 <p>With Waste Management, recycling goes beyond just bottles, cans and paper. Some things we are used to throwing away can often be safely recycled too, 
 from old TV remotes to batteries to compact fluorescent bulbs and more.</p>

<div id="f3">
<h1>HOW IT WORKS</h2>
<img src="image/elec2.jpg" align="right">
<p>Our mail-order recycling kits come with everything you need, from the box to the return shipping label. Simply enter your address to get a list of all 
Recycle by Mail services available in your area, select the items you want to recycle and then order the kit online. From there, all you have to
 do is pack up your bulbs, batteries or electronics and send the kit back.</p>
